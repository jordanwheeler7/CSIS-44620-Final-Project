# Goal
Being a service member, we are seeing the retention issue as well as the lack of recruits coming in. This article speaks on the issues and addresses some of the concerns. I want to see how the media portrays this issue versus what we are told and see as active service members.

I am planning on seeing the top issues that are leading to the recruitment issue from a media perspective. I want to see how the media portrays this and the sentiment that is implied. We hear a lot about this topic in daily activities and I want to see the difference between our information and what the media portrays.
